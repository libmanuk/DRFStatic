# minimalCM

minimalCM is a framework for building a very lightweight content management system intended for small or large digital libraries.  It emphasizes a microservices approach.  Also described as microservice architecture, this approach structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement an intended purpose. A microservice architecture promotes simplicity and enables an evolving technology stack.
